# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis-using-Tableau

## Project Overview

Develop a Tableau project for Electric Vehicles to extract valuable insights.<br>
Construct a comprehensive dashboard that includes the following components:<br>

## Tools

1.Tableau<br>
2.Excel<br>


## KPI's Requirement

1.**Total Vechicle**: Identify the overall landscape of electric vehicle to assess the market's size and growth.<br>
2.**Average Electric Range**: Determine the average electric range of electric vechicle to know the efficiency of the EV'S. <br>
3.**Total BEV Vehicles and %of Total BEV Vechicle**:Identify the total number of battery electric vehicle and its percentage from total electric vehicles.<br>
4.**Total PHEV Vehicles and %of Total PHEV Vechicle**:Identify the total number of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and its percentage from total electric vehicles.<br>


## Visualizations

1.**Total Vehicles by Model Year(Line/Area Chart)**: Visualize the distribution of electric vehicles over the years.<br>
2.**Total Vehicles by State (Map Chart)**:Showcase the geographical distribution of electric vehicle across different states.<br>
3.**Total Vehicles by Model (Tree Map)**: Visualize the total electric vehicle models,know the popular models in the market.<br>
4.**Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility (Pie Chart)**: Illustrate the proporation of electric vehicle that are eligible for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives.<br>
5.**Top 10 Vehicles by Make (Bar Chart)**: Highlight the top 10 electric vehicle manufactures based on the total number of electric vehicles.<br>

## Slicers for Enhanced Analysis

Four Slicers are used to analyze dynamically:<br>
1.CAFV Eligibility<br>
2.Model<br>
3.City<br>
4.Electric Vehicle Type<br>


## Conclusion

The Electric Vehicles Dashboard gives a clear view of EV sales,growth and market treds. From the data, we see that EV sales are increasing<br>
every year.The top Ev models are Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and top manufactures are Tesla,Nissan,Chevrolet and Ford.This helps companies to <br>
make better plans for EV production and sales etc.
